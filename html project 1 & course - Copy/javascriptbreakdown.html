    <h1>All you need to know about JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Breakdown of JavaScript fundamentals</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It can be included in HTML files using the &lt;script&gt; tag.</p>

        <h3>Variable</h3>
        <p>A variable is a named storage location for data. It can hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, or objects. We use let, and const to create variables.</p><br>
        <h3>Naming variables</h3>
        <p>When naming variables, it's important to choose descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable. Variable names can include letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter. They must also be unique within their scope. Also, a variable name must be all one word with no spaces, so when we want to make a name with multiple words we use camel case, where we start with a lower case letter and then uppercase for the first letter of all other words.</p><br>
        <h3>values</h3>
        <p>Values are the actual data stored in variables. They can be of different types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, or objects. A variable with a stored value looks like this, const city = chicago;</p><br>
        <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>JavaScript has several data types, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>String: Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello, world!" A string is enclosed in quotes.</li>
            <li>Number: Represents numeric values, e.g., 42 or 3.14</li>
            <li>Boolean: Represents a true/false value. Booleans are simply written as true or false.</li>
            <li>Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs where each key (called a property) is a string, and each value can be any data type (including other objects or arrays).</li>
            <li>Array: Represents an ordered list of values. An array is enclosed in square brackets, e.g., [1, 2, 3].</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Let and Const differences</h3>
        <p>Both let and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript, but they have some key differences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scope: let has block scope, meaning it's only accessible within the block it's defined in. const also has block scope, but its value cannot be reassigned.</li>
            <li>Reassignment: Variables declared with let can be reassigned new values, while const variables cannot be reassigned once they're set.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>An object is a collection of key-value pairs that represent data and functionality. Objects can contain properties and methods.</p>
        <h3>properties</h3>
        <p>Properties are characteristics or attributes of an object. They are defined as key-value pairs within an object. For example, if we have an object representing a person, it might have properties like name, age, and occupation.</p><br>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>Methods are functions stored as properties inside objects. A method lets an object perform actions or operations. Below is an example of an object where greet is a method of the person object.</p>
        <pre>
        const person = {
            name: "Alice",
            greet: function() {
                return "hello";
            }
        }
        </pre>
        <h3>console</h3>
        <p>The console is a built-in debugging tool in web browsers and Node.js that allows developers to log messages, inspect variables, and interact with the JavaScript environment. It can be accessed through the browser's developer tools. We can also run JavaScript code directly in the console using console.log() in order to run particular snippets of code. Whenever we put a variable inside console.log, the console itself will display the value.</p>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take parameters and return a value.</p><br>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>JavaScript syntax refers to the set of rules that define how JavaScript code is written. It includes the use of semicolons to end statements, curly braces to define blocks of code, and parentheses to group expressions. For example, a simple function syntax looks like this:</p>
        <pre>
        function myFunction() {
            console.log("Hello, world!");
        }
        </pre>
        <h3>Event</h3>
        <p>An event is an action that occurs in the browser, such as a click or a key press. JavaScript can respond to events using event listeners.</p><br>
        <h2>Exploring JavaScript deeper</h2>
        <h3>Updating let variables</h3>
        <p>Variables declared with let can be updated or reassigned. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
        let count = 0;
        count = 1;
        console.log(count); // Output: 1
        </pre>
        <h3>Understanding operators</h3>
        <p>Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on values. JavaScript has various types of operators, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic operators: Used for mathematical calculations, e.g., + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division).</li>
            <li>Comparison operators: Used to compare values, e.g., == (equal), != (not equal), &gt; (greater than), &lt; (less than).</li>
            <li>Logical operators: Used to combine or negate boolean values, e.g., && (and), || (or), ! (not).</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Using conditions</h3>
        <p>Conditions allow us to execute different code blocks based on certain criteria. In JavaScript, we can use if statements to create conditional logic. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
        let age = 18;
        if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You are an adult.");
        }
        </pre>
